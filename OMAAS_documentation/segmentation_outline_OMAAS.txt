- use 2d image
- make points at maxima for each heart view using skimage.feature module:
	> peaks_of_image = skimage.feature.peak_local_max(img2, num_peaks = 4, min_distance=100) # consider changing the min_distance
- assign those peaks to the points layer:
	> viewer.layers["SAM points"].data = peaks_of_image
- confirm annotations
- optional (to-be-done): create surrounding box for each mask fro cropping and rearranging
